The mean of a set of values cannot be greater than the largest value in the set, or smaller than the smallest value in the set.

    "## Statistics for Simulation with 100 iterations, 4,000 target pop\n",
    "All statistics here were calculated on the RTI synthetic incomes dataset, limited to point features within the boundary of Hennepin County, MN. We ran our simulated \"build balanced zones\" with 100 iterations, each iteration building zones with a goal of 4,000 total population and a secondary goal of dense collections of census blocks per zone (aka \"Compaction\"). The basic units in constructing these zones were census blocks. After zones were constructed, income point features were spatially joined to their respective zones and the mean income was calculated. For each iteration, six income inequality measures were calculated. Here we focus solely on Gini. The distribution of Gini indexes across the full simulation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avg Gini:\t0.20262972\n",
    "- Stdev Gini:\t0.001712671\n",
    "- Min Gini:\t0.198333698\n",
    "- Max Gini:\t0.205906122\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating Gini on real census tracts averages, it was **0.218685**, higher than the max Gini we found in our simulation. The simulation seems to show that census tracts are abnormally defined, tending to group households of similar income levels together. On the other hand, zones generated using only metrics of similar population and preferring dense, globular clusters tend to represent a more complete distribution of incomes within their bounds, resulting in a lower overall Gini value when differences between average zonal income are summarised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantification of how abnormal census tracts are in terms of Gini outcomes will be explored next, by fitting a distribution to the simulated results. Similar tests will be performed on the other income statistics. In addition to showing that the census tracts of today are unlikely, our simulation distribution shows that under the population constraint Gini is relatively stable, with a standard deviation of less than 0.01. This variation is inconsequential when compared to the difference between Gini on ungrouped incomes and block averages, underlining the findings in the previous section. In addition, we will attempt to gain a better mathematical understanding of the Theil and Atkinson indexes based on their behavior in simulation."
